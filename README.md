## üìÅ Data & Context

This project fetches live cryptocurrency data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
Static data such as currency options, navigation links, and pagination settings are stored in the src/data folder for easy maintenance.

State management is handled via React Context to keep UI state, filters, pagination, and theme consistent across the app without prop drilling.

These contexts enable clean, cross-component data flow without prop drilling.
